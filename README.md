## Introduction

So, hey there! I started some weeks ago... It's called Fundr...

Everything was going well until I tampered with dev dependencies on the former project/repo... And things stopped working as they should...

Life of blockchain developerðŸ¤§ðŸ˜…

## Overview

Now we're here, Fundr is a blockchain application that serves as a decentralized solution to traditional/centralized crowdfunding...

At the moment of development, I'm following a course for this project... Once I'm done, I would redesign the dApp and change the code (Next.js) to match the new design...

Also, I will update this README as I progress in the development process.

So, let's fire on!!!
